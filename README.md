## Game Features

The user will use **WASD** keys to control the HERO TANK and could choose between the new game and resume the last game through the game log file.<br/><br/>
The right hand side is the side bar that records the number of enemies that has been killed and the types of them. Each enemy tank will have a different armor level that could prevent the bullet.

Each bullet and the enemy tank is an independent thread that can change the direction and shoot the bullet byself.<br/>

The game can be made to be more challenging and interesting by adding more features (obstacles, difficulty selections and more), it is a very good practice for beginners.
